# Interactive pages
There are multiple pages including various plots and a sorting table
The first plot page (_"Test Your Genre"_) contains three widgets: **Gender**, **Education level**, and **daily time spend on internet**.
User can select the choices that match them the best and observe the changes on plots.
* _"Test Your Genre"_ contains two interactive plots: a _bar plot_ for **genre anlysis** and a _pie chart_ for **music enjoyment analysis** (_How many people with similar demographics enjoy listening to music_)

The second plot page (_"Male/Female Interest towards Genres"_) analyzes the **interest values** males and females have demonstrated towards **different genres** as their age increases. 
* _"Male/Female Interest towards Genres"_ contains a line plot describing the trend both genders have demonstrated towards a **selected** genre over the course of _15_ years (_15-30_)

The table page shows some important columns of the dataset. There are some selection box that allows users to observe the specific ages, genders, tempo preferences, hours spend on the internet, and education levels.
